## What?

A temporary home for the Insights API definition

## Where?

https://signalft.github.io/InsightsApi/index.html

## For how long?

* We will stop maintaining these static docs around the end of April. We will maintain the changelog.
* At some point after that, we will "stamp" out a v1 of the docs
  * Non-breaking changes will still be v1
  * Breaking changes will be v2+

Our intent is to minimize breaking changes for obvious reasons. Full, official documentation about our API support policies will be available in Q2/Q3 of 2022.

## Changelog

Around mid-April 2022 we will start adding to the changelog.

* YYYY-MM-DD: Foo
* YYYY-MM-DD: Bar
